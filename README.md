his is a small project I designed mostly for the benifit of me and my friends.

Basically, it searches the gatherer for planeschase cards and keeps a file on them. It then provides uses with an interface that lets them view a random planeschase card.  The card also acts as a link to the gatherer's page on the card.  Additionally, uses are provided with a virtual planar die that can be "rolled".

....in other words, it lets you and your mates play Planeschase without needed to have planeschase cards.

If you want to use my code, awesome.

If you want to modify my code, even more awesome (I am interested to see what you can do to improve it).

I just ask that you give me credit and link to the github page.

Anyways, I hope you enjoy it as much as me and my friends.
