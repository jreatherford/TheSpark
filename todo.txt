Things that I need to change before I will be ready to host this online:

Make the interface prettier
Add an "About" page
Improve Documentation

Improve the update function (this acually can be done after I host it online)
	Updates on command, not just when there are no cards
	Makes backups before update
	Can look for problems with updates (e.g., less cards in new version)
