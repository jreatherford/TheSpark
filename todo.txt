Things that need to be changed:

Fix the ugly border around the corners of cards

Make it so the screen does not have to refresh each time.

Improve the update function
	Updates on command, not just when there are no cards
	Makes backups before update
	Can look for problems with updates (e.g., less cards in new version)
